# AutoDLTorch

## Plan of Action

### Models:
- [x] MLP
- [x] ANN/DNN
- [x] AutoEncoders
- [x] Convolutional Neural Networks
- [x] Sequential Models (RNN/LSTM/Gated Networks)
- [x] GANs
- [x] VAEs
- [x] Attention Networks (on RNN/ on LSTM/ Custom Addition)
- [x] Transformers

### Next Steps:

- [ ] Employ effective training using Hydra and Pytorch, with WANDB support.
- [ ] Effective Transformer Training and implementations for Various Tasks.
